# ML-stroke-prediction

According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled.

This repository contains a suite of machine learning models (lasso regression, logistic regresison, Naive Bayes Classifiers, Decision Trees) for stroke prediction, based on parameters such as age, average glucose level, body-mass index, smoking status etc.

The dataset used (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/st roke-prediction-dataset) is found on Kaggle and contains information about age, gender, BMI (and 7 other parameters) along with whether or not the patient has had a stroke. Each row in the dataset provides relevant information about each of the 5110 patients.

For a bried outlook of the project, consult the appended presentation (either in PowerPoint or pdf format), or the relevant HTML file.
